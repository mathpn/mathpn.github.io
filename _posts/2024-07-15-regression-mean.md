Regression to the mean is the statistical tendency for extreme measurements to be followed by values closer to the mean. In simpler terms, things tend to even out. Most of us have an intuitive grasp of this concept, but it's useful to understand it in more depth.

Why do things tend to even out? Why do measurements tend towards the mean? When should we expect regression to the mean to happen? Isn't all of this too obvious? I'll try to answer these questions here.
