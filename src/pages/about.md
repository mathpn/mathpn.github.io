My name is Matheus and I live in Brazil. I currently work as a data scientist and developer. My goal here is to condense interesting thoughts into written form, making things as simple as possible, but not any simpler.

There is a great piece of advice from [David Robinson](https://x.com/drob/status/928447584712253440):

> When you've written the same code 3 times, write a function
>
> When you've given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post

## Topics

I am interested in machine learning, data analysis, software development in general. I also (try to) play the piano. This website is a living entity, so I might add new things in the near future.
