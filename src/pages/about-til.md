title: "About today I learned (TIL)"
---

In this section, I document interesting things that I've recently learned. It could be a new concept, a tidbit of history, an interesting tool, or even a fact about science or technology.

## What to Expect

- Brief summaries of what I've learned
- Links to resources where I found the information (so you can learn more too!)
- Occasional notes on how this new knowledge has impacted my thinking or projects

## Why TIL?

The "Today I Learned" section is a way for me to reflect on what I've gained, share my discoveries with others, and potentially help someone out there who's looking for answers. It's also a fun way to keep track of all the cool things I've learned over time!
