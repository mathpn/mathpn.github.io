This is the first in a series of posts about decision trees in the context of machine learning. The goal here is to provide a foundational understanding of decision trees and implement them.

Decision trees are not amazing algorithms by themselves. They have limitations that can result in suboptimal and even weird predictions.
And yet, they have become extremely popular. Some would even say they are the _de facto_ go-to algorithm for many machine learning domains.
This is due to _bagging_ and _boosting_, techniques that turned subpar decision trees into state-of-the-art algorithms. We'll explore them in the future.

First, we'll build an intuition for what are decision trees and define them mathematically. Then, we'll explore how decision trees are built. This will allow us to grasp their main characteristics, advantages and disadvantages.

## What is a decision tree?

Imagine you're trying to decide whether to take an umbrella when leaving home. You might ask questions like: _"Are there clouds?"_. If yes, you might then ask _"What's the humidity level?"_. Each question helps you narrow down the decision. This is how a decision tree works.

Let's simulate this weather example:

![Scatter plot of humidity and cloud coverage showing that it's more likely to rain when its cloudy and humid](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_conditions.png)

A decision tree can be thought of as making consecutive decisions by asking a series of questions about our data.
Each internal tree _node_ uses a certain feature (in our example, cloud cover or humidity) to divide its region into two using a split value.
Each new region can be further divided into two. A node that divides its region into two is called an _internal node_.

_Leaf (or terminal) nodes_ don't ask any more questions, but rather provide a prediction for its region. In our example, it might say _"Rain"_ or _"No rain"_. More precisely, it assigns a probability for each outcome.

Let's take a look at a decision tree fitted to our weather example:

![Graph of decision tree splits](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_tree.svg)

This decision tree was kept intentionally small.
From top to bottom, this graph represents all decision boundaries of our simple tree.
Each internal node produces two _branches_, that is, two paths that can be followed. These branches recursively partitions the feature space such that the samples with the same labels or similar target values are grouped together.
For instance, we predict that it'll rain if humidity is above 59% and cloud cover is above 45% (rightmost path in the graph) because most points (_instances_) in this region are of the "Rain" class.

The class shown is only relevant for leaf nodes, that is, those at the bottom row.
The `value` property shows how many samples there are for each class in each region.
A _pure node_ has only instances of one class in its region. Since all nodes contain at least one instance of both classes (that is, "Rain" and "No Rain"), all nodes are _impure_.
The objective during training is to _reduce impurity_ as much as possible. If all nodes are pure, then the tree has _zero error_ on the training data set. This is how decision trees learn.

This visualization of the tree is very easy to interpret. We can follow each path and clearly see why a prediction was made, that is, the model is easily _explainable_ (the opposite of a _black-box_ model). This is one of the reasons why decision trees are popular. Simple decision trees can even be applied in some practical settings (e.g. medicine) without machine assistance.

We can also visualize the decision boundaries of the tree by overlaying them onto the scatter plot of our data:

![Scatter plot of humidity and cloud coverage showing prediction regions from a decision tree](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_conditions_with_shallow_tree.png)

We can see the straight boundaries between regions. More formally, a decision tree is a hierarchical structure that recursively divide our features into _cuboid regions_. Since we have 2 features (2 dimensions) in our example, the cuboid regions are squares.

## Types of trees

Broadly, there are two types of decision trees: _classification_ and _regression_ trees. While they share the same fundamental structure and splitting methodology, they differ in their output and how they make predictions.

Classification trees are designed to predict categorical outcomes -- they assign input data to predefined classes or categories.
At each leaf node, the tree predicts the most common class among the training samples that reached that node.
Our weather example involves a classification tree and the leaves predict whether it will rain or not.
The prediction is made by counting the proportion of training samples of each class at the leaf node and selecting the majority class.
Think of it as the tree asking a series of yes/no questions about the input features until it can make an educated guess about which category the input belongs to.

Regression trees, on the other hand, predict continuous numerical values rather than categories.
Instead of predicting a class at each leaf node, regression trees typically output the average value of all training samples that reached that node.
For instance, a regression tree might predict a house's price based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
Each split in the tree tries to group together similar numerical values.
When a new example comes in, the tree can guide it to a leaf node containing training examples with similar target values and use their average as the prediction.

## Mathematical definition

Mathematically, a decision tree can be described as:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m \mathbf{I}(x \in R_m)
$$

Where $x$ are the input features, $R_m$ is the $m$'th region and $w_m$ is the value of this region. $\mathbf{I}(x \in R_m)$ is 1 if $x$ is contained in the $m$'th region, 0 otherwise. The values $w$ are typically a constant (regression) or a vector of probabilities (classification). The combination of regions and values defines the decision tree.

The regions cannot assume arbitrary boundaries, though. They are always _parallel_ to some axis and can only divide a previous region into two.
This can be a limitation, but it greatly reduces the computational complexity of constructing a decision tree. In our weather example, it's trivial to find the following decision boundary using other methods (I have used logistic regression):

![Weather scatter plot with diagonal decision boundary](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_conditions_boundary.png)

However, axis-parallel splits (single feature) are much easier to compute than oblique splits (multiple features). Finding the best split of a single feature involves sorting the data and evaluating splits.
Since the latter is negligible compared to sorting, this operation has a [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) of $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points.
To find the best oblique split combining two features, however, we must first consider all possible $O(n^2)$ lines formed by pairs of points.
For each line, you need to evaluate which side each point falls on: $O(n)$. This amounts to a total time complexity of $O(n^3)$.
More generally, an oblique split has a time complexity of $O(n^{d+1})$, in which $d$ is the number of features.
Therefore, we compromise on using only axis-parallel splits, which define cuboid regions.

Each region $R_m$ is defined by a path from the root to the $m$'th leaf of the tree. For instance, consider the path that defines the region $R = \{(Humidity,\ Cloud)\ |\ Humidity > 59\ \text{and}\ Cloud > 45\}$.

![Path between the root node and a leaf node](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_tree_path.svg)

This region can be visualized on the scatter plot:

![Defined region in scatter plot](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_conditions_region.png)

Unlike linear models, decision trees do not model the entire data distribution. Rather, each region has independent predicted values.
More formally, adding all independent regions defines a [piecewise function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_function) that can approximate any pattern in the data, but it may struggle to represent smooth or continuous functions properly.

## Bias-variance tradeoff

TODO add sources

As all other machine learning algorithms, trees are also haunted by the bias-variance tradeoff.
If this concept is new to you, I highly recommend reading about it first, but come back later.

<details>
  <summary>Bias-variance tradeoff refresher</summary>
  In summary, _bias_ refers to the error that a model makes due to
  oversimplification of relationships between features (_underfitting_).
  _Variance_ measures how sensitive model predictions are to small fluctuations
  in the training set. High variance means that the model is capturing _noise_
  rather than true relationships (_overfitting_). Reducing bias tends to
  increase variance and vice-versa. Finding an optimal bias-variance balance is
  crucial to achieve good prediction accuracy.
</details>

### Decision tree variance

TODO explain variance due to greedy

Due to the non-linear and non-smooth nature of trees, they easily capture noise.
Thus, deeper trees present more variance.
If you fully grow a tree, it will partition the feature space until the error is zero[^almost_zero_error].
The model will have effectively _memorized_ the training set -- including noise -- which results in _overfitting_.

[^almost_zero_error]: The error may not reach zero if and only if there are two or more points with _exactly_ the same feature values but different target values.

If we rebuild our example tree until the error is 0 we get the following regions:

![Scatter plot of humidity and cloud coverage showing prediction regions from a deep decision tree](../../assets/images/climbing-trees-1/weather_conditions_with_deep_tree.png)

It has perfect accuracy, but it has very unusual boundaries due to noise (high variance). This model doesn't generalize well, that is, it would score poorly with new data. There are different ways to limit tree variance, namely:

- Limiting depth
- Requiring a minimum number of points per node
- Requiring a minimum decrease in loss to split the node

TODO: The last one is usually not a good idea for a reason we'll see later.

Another possibility is to fully grow the tree and later _prune it_ to balance complexity and accuracy.

Let's build decision trees with increasing depths on a toy dataset:

import TreeDepthSlider from "@assets/js/climbing-trees/frame-slider.tsx";

<TreeDepthSlider client:load />

On the left we can see the training set[^sampling] with two features and two classes. We're building _classification_ trees, whose boundaries are overlaid onto the left plot.
The plot on the right shows training and test error, as well as the error of a logistic regression model as a baseline.
The test set was sampled from the same distribution, but is different from the training set.
Use the slider to compare depths. We can see that the best test error happens with a depth of 3.
Increasing the depth further results in overfitting.

### Decision tree bias

Even with a depth of three in the example above the error is larger than the logistic regression baseline. This is an example where linear models outperform decision trees due to the _additive structure_ of the data. The [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) equation in this case is:

$$
logit(p) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{2} + \varepsilon
$$

Where $p$ is the probability of the outcome being of class 1. Ignoring constants and the noise ($\varepsilon$), the probability is determined by a linear combination of both features. The relationship between features is not _hierarchical_, therefore decision trees require multiple, sometimes redundant, splits to approximate this concept, leading to deep or overly complex trees.

There are other concepts that fall under the same category, such as:

- XOR (Exclusive OR): the output is of one class if _exactly one_ (but not both) of two inputs is true.
- Parity problem: the output is different if the number of true values in a set of inputs is even or odd.
- Multiplexer problem: a multiplexer selects one of several input values based on a separate "selector" input.

These may seem overly specific, but they're used as benchmarks to test the capabilities machine learning algorithms.
Additive structure, XOR and parity involve global dependencies that require multiple inputs to be considered together.
Decision trees split data based on one feature at a time, therefore are inefficient at capturing these relationships.
Multiplexer problems require conditional rules which are not hierarchical, making the tree very large to account for all combinations of selector-input pairs.

In more complex real-world datasets, it's quite likely that multiple non-hierarchical concepts are present, leading to large bias. If they have subpar variance _and_ bias, decision trees may look like a poor choice of algorithm. Indeed, they rarely shine on their own, but rather as _ensembles_ (with bagging or boosting), which we'll cover in the future.

[^sampling]: Each class was sampled from a Bivariate (2D) Gaussian distribution with SD=1. One class is shifted by 1.5 units both up and to the right.
