A while ago, I've built a small project called `hoarder-miniflux-webhook` ([repo here](https://github.com/mathpn/karakeep-miniflux-webhook)).
Its goal is to connect [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) (an RSS feed reader) with [Karakeep](https://karakeep.app/) (a "Bookmark Everything" app) through a webhook.
This integration allows you to automatically save your Miniflux entries to Karakeep.

Karakeep was formerly known as Hoarder, so I have renamed the project to `karakeep-miniflux-webhook` and changed all the references to the old name.
Old environment variables still work for retrocompatibility reasons.
