I'm reading [_The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering) by Richard Hamming.
Yes, the same Hamming behind Hamming codes and Hamming distance.

Right on the first chapter he cites a well-known adage about predicting the future:

> There is a saying, “Short-term predictions are always optimistic and long-term predictions are always pessimistic.”
> The reason, so it is claimed, the second part is true is that for most people the geometric growth due to the compounding of knowledge is hard to grasp.<br/><cite>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering -- Richard Hamming</cite>

Then he offers artificial intelligence as a counterexample, noting that AI leaders had made predictions that:

> [...] have almost never come true, and are not likely to do so within your lifetime [...]

The book was published in 1997, based on a course Hamming taught at the Naval Postgraduate School.
Most of his students are likely still alive today.
His skepticism towards AI probably refelcts the [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) climate of the time.
He was right that AI experts had been making far-fetched predictions for decades.
But with hindsight, those were actually the _optimistic_ predictions.
The thing is, AI's "short-term" took decades.
Now here we are with LLMs, speech recognition, computer vision, and so on.
If anything, this confirms the adage's truth.

This isn't a critique of Hamming.
After all, he knew predicting the future is hard.
There is a whole section about AI later in the book that seems to propose interesting conceptual questions, though I haven't read it yet.
So far, I'm enjoying the book's goal to think about thinking and learning for the future.
