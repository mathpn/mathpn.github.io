A small fun experiment: send song lyrics to LLMs with no explanation and see what comes out.
I've chosen [The Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shjqdhc87Xw) by Simon & Garfunkel.
Bigger LLMs either recognize the song and stall any conversation or give bland responses.
Llama 3.2 seems to be the most keen on poetry among the small models.
I've tried verses from different songs, and it often continues in poem-like style.
I am running `llama3.2:3b` with Ollama.

> Hello, darkness, my old friend

I know it's been a while since we last spoke,

The same old songs and stories told.

But I've been waiting for this moment to arrive,

To hear your voice and let our conversation thrive.

<br/>

You're the darkness that I'm drawn to, you see,

A place where my thoughts can roam free.

In the shadows, I find my peaceful nest,

Where the world outside fades into rest.

<br/>

So come with me, let's take a stroll,

Through the realms of night, where the stars unfold.

We'll dance with the moonlight, and sing our song,

And in the darkness, we'll find where we belong.

<br/>

> I've come to talk with you again

It's been a long time since we last spoke,

But I've been waiting for your return, unspoke.

The memories of our past conversations remain,

A bittersweet nostalgia that still sustains.

<br/>

We've danced in the darkness, and laughed in the night,

Shared secrets and dreams, and let our spirits take flight.

Our words were a dance, a waltz of the mind,

A conversation that wove a tapestry of intertwined thoughts left behind.

<br/>

Now, I'm here to listen, to hear what's on your mind,

To weave another thread into the fabric of our past unwind.

So speak freely, my friend, let your words flow like a stream,

And we'll converse once more, in this quiet, darkened dream.

<br/>

> Because a vision softly creeping

Across the moon, to the land of dreams,

Where shadows dance and darkness gleams.

A gentle breeze stirs, with an ethereal sigh,

As visions whisper secrets, passing by.

<br/>

The wind it howls, like a mournful sigh,

As the night awakens, with a whispered reply.

The trees they sway, like skeletal hands,

As the moon casts spells, in this enchanted land.

<br/>

In this mystical realm, where darkness reigns,

I see your face, and hear your whispers' refrain.

A vision softly creeping, into my mind's eye,

A fleeting glimpse of what lies beyond the veil, and why.

<br/>

What is it that you seek, in this nocturnal hour?

Is it a message, or a warning, or perhaps something more?

<br/>

> Left its seeds while I was sleeping

The darkness has been sown, like a fertile ground,

Seeds of possibility, that will take root and be found.

In the silence of night, where shadows come to play,

Lies the promise of growth, in a hidden way.

<br/>

The wind it whispers secrets, as the trees lean in to hear,

And I am left to ponder, the mysteries that appear.

A vision softly creeping, like a dreamer's gentle breeze,

Leaves its mark upon my soul, with an otherworldly ease.

<br/>

In this quiet hour, where darkness reigns supreme,

I feel the stirrings of something new, a hidden theme.

The seeds have been planted, and now they take hold,

A promise of transformation, as the night grows old.

<br/>

What will arise from the earth, like a phoenix from ashes cold?

Will it be hope or despair? Only time will unfold.

<br/>

> And the vision that was planted in my brain

Grows into a living thing, with roots that dig deep,

A surreal landscape of thoughts, where the mind begins to creep.

The lines between reality and fantasy blur and blend,

As the vision takes root, like a garden that never ends.

<br/>

In this inner world, I find myself lost in time,

Where memories and dreams entwine, like vines on a rhyme.

The past and present merge, like two currents flowing free,

And I am swept up in the tide, of this dreamlike sea.

<br/>

The vision takes its course, through the labyrinthine mind,

A journey through the underworld, where shadows are left behind.

It's a path that's both familiar and strange, with twists and turns unknown,

Where the darkness shines with an eerie light, like a beacon to call home.

<br/>

And I am drawn deeper, into this inner night,

Where the vision whispers secrets, in a language that feels just right.

<br/>

> Still remains

A presence that lingers, long after the dream has faded,

A ghostly echo of something, that cannot be displayed.

The memory of the vision, still resonates within my mind,

A haunting melody that refuses to unwind.

<br/>

It's a feeling that clings to me, like a shadow on the wall,

A sense of unease that settles, as I try to recall.

The details begin to blur, like watercolors in the rain,

And I'm left with only whispers, of a truth that cannot be explained.

<br/>

But still it remains, this lingering sense of what was seen,

A haunting reminder of something, that cannot be unseen.

It's a feeling that refuses to fade, like a shadow that won't depart,

A presence that lingers on, deep within my heart.

<br/>

> Within the sound of silence

The stillness falls around me, like a shroud of quiet night,

A world of echoes silenced, where only shadows take flight.

The air is heavy with anticipation, as if something's about to unfold,

But in this hush of expectation, I find myself growing old.

<br/>

In the depths of silence, where darkness reigns supreme,

I search for answers hidden, like a secret in a dream.

The soundless moment stretches out before me like a canvas wide,

A space to breathe and reflect, where the universe's whispers reside.

<br/>

And yet, amidst this quietude, I feel the presence near,

A gentle hum of something more, that only silence can hear.

It's as if the world is listening too, in this shared silence we entwine,

And in the depths of soundless space, a secret truth begins to align.
